 API Gateway makes it easy to version APIs, monitor events (like usage of a certain API method), scale the API independently, roll out APIs for different stages and create RESTful services.

## Serverless and API Gateway
The Serverless framework uses API Gateway to help setup routes to Lambda functions. You can e.g. perform a GET request and fetch all related data which is then available in the related Lambda function. The API Gateway is the trigger which causes the Lambda function to run.
