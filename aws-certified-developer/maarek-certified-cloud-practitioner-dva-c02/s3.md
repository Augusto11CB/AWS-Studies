# S3

### S3 Use Cases

* Backup and storage.
* Disaster Recovery.
* Archive.
* Hybrid Cloud storage.
* Application hosting.
* Media hosting.
* Data lakes & big data analytics.
* Software delivery.
* Static websit.

### Amazon S3 - Buckets

* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories).
* Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts).
* :warning:Buckets are defined at the region level.
* S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region.
* **Naming convention:**
  * No uppercase or underscore.
  * 3-63 characters long.
  * Not an IP.
  * Must start with lowercase letter or number.
  * Must NOT start with the prefix `xn--`.
  * Must NOT end with the suffix `-s3alias`.

### Amazon S3 - Objects

* Objects (\~files) have a **key**.
* The key is the FULL path:
  * `s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt`
  * `s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt`
* The key is composed of prefix + **object** name:
  * `s3://my-bucket/`_`my_folder1/another_folder/`_**`my_file.txt`**
* There’s **no concept of “directories” within buckets** (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise).
  * Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”) S3 Bucket.
* Object values are the content of the body:
  * Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB).
  * If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”.
* **Metadata** (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata).
* **Tags** (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle.
* **Version ID** (if versioning is enabled).



### Amazon S3 - Security

* User-based:
  * IAM Policies - which API calls shoud be allowed for a specific user from IAM.
* Resource-Based
  * Buckets Policies - Bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allow cross account.
  * Object Access Control List (ACL) - Less Common (can be disabled).
  * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - Less common (can be disabled).
* **Note:** An IAM Principal can access an S3 Object if:
  * The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it.
  * AND there is no explicit DENY.
* **Encryption:** Encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys.



### Amazon S3 - Bucket Policies

*   Json based policies:

    * Resources: buckets and objects.
    * Effect: Allow/Deny.
    * Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny.
    * Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to.

* Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  * Grant public access to the bucket.
  * Force objects to be encrypted at upload.
  * Grant access to another account (Cross Account).

**Example: Public Access - Use Bucket Policy**

**Example: User Access to S3 - IAM permissions**

**Example: EC2 instance access - Use IAM Roles**

**Example: (Advanced) Cross-Account Access - Use Bucket Policy**

### Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

* This config can be set at the account level.

### Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting

* S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet.
* The website URL will be (depending on the region):
  * http://**bucket-name**.s3-website-**aws-region**.amazonaws.com.
  * http://**bucket-name**.s3-website.**aws-region**.amazonaws.com.
* If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!

### Amazon S3 - Versioning

* You can version your files in Amazon S3.
* It is enabled at the bucket level.
* Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1, 2, 3 ....
* It is best practice to version your buckets.
  * Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version).
  * easy roll back to previous version.
* Notes:
  * Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null".
  * Suspending versioning does not delete previous versions.



### Amazon S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)

* :warning:Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets.
* Cross-Region Replication (CRR).
* Same-Region Replication (SRR).
* Buckets can be in different AWS accounts.
* Copying is asynchronous.
* :warning:Must give proper IAM permissions to S3.
* **Use cases:**
  * CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts.
  * SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts.

#### Amazon S3 – Replication (Notes)

* :warning:After you enable Replication, only new objects are replicated.
* Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using **S3 Batch Replication**.
  * Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication.
* For DELETE operations
  * Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting).
  * Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes).
* There is no "chaining" of replication:
  * If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3.
  * Then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3.
