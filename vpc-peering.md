# VPC Peering

A _virtual private cloud_ (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. **It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud**.

**A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between** them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.&#x20;

By using VPC Peering, instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.&#x20;

It is possible to create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different Regions (also known as an inter-Region VPC peering connection).
