# Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is, according to Amazon,
> â€¦a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster.

It is comparable to Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Azure Container Service.

ECS runs containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) virtual machine instances pre-installed with Docker.

## ECS Terms (Task Definition, Task, and Service)

Task definition is the blueprint describing which Docker containers to run and represents the application.

**Task**
An instance of a Task Definition, running the containers detailed within it. Multiple Tasks can be created by one Task Definition, as demand requires.
