### Cloud Deployment Types

* Cloud-Based Deployment (Public Cloud)
* On-Premise Cloud Deployment (Private Cloud)
* Hybrid Cloud Deployment
  * Examples of usage of this deployment: Bursting Up.
    *   Dynamically scale resources from a private cloud to a public cloud when additional capacity is required.

        Let's consider a retail company that operates primarily on a private cloud infrastructure hosted in their own data centers. During normal business operations, their private cloud infrastructure adequately handles the average customer demand. However, during seasonal sales or promotional events, the website experiences a significant increase in traffic, requiring additional computing resources to handle the surge in user activity.

        To address this situation, the retail company can implement a hybrid cloud architecture. They can maintain their day-to-day operations on their private cloud, ensuring data security and compliance. However, when traffic spikes occur, they can leverage bursting up capabilities to dynamically scale their resources by extending their infrastructure into the public cloud, such as utilising AWS's public cloud services.

### AWS Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of best practices and guidelines developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help customers design and build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient cloud-based architectures.

It provides a structured approach for evaluating architectures, identifying areas of improvement, and making informed decisions when designing and operating workloads in the AWS cloud.

#### **1. Operational Excellence Design**

* Perform operation as **CODE.**
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
* Learn from operational failures.
* Anticipate failure.
* Refine operations procedures frequently

#### 2. Security Design

* Enable traceability.
* Keep People away from data.
* Implement strong identity foundation.
* Protect data in transit and rest.

#### 3. Reliability Design

* Test recovery procedures (verify if you can restore your backup).
* Stop guessing capacity.
* Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability.
* Manage change in automation.

#### 4. Performance Design

* Go global in minutes.
* Experiment more often.
* access advanced tech.

#### 5. Cost Optimisation

* Implement cloud financial management.
* Analyse and attribute expenditure.

### AWS Shared Responsibility Mode

* Customers have complete control over their content and are responsible for managing critical content security:
  * Content stored on AWS.
  * Country where content is stored.
  * Access to that content.
  * “from layer three upwards”.
* AWS Responsibilities:
  * 24/7 security staffing.
  * Undisclosed locations.
  * “from Layer two downwards”.

### AWS Cloud Value Propositions

* Cost:
  * Eliminates large upfront investments for: cabling, cooling, power, network, racks, servers, certifications and labor.
  * Pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-use.
* Agility
  * Users can leverage the infrastructure for speed, experimentation and innovation.
* “Universal” Access
  * Represents anywhere, anytime access to resources.
* Elasticity
  * Unlimited scalability and dynamic provisioning & processioning of processing, storage, database, and memory.
  * Allows organisations to shift and pool resources over different infrastructures to avoid over-provisioning and cost overruns.
  * Scalability is ≠ than elasticity as it increases (**only**) workloads over existing HW resources only (elasticity increases VMs on existing HW).
* Demand-Driven service
  * It allows users to provision cloud resources as needed automatically and rapidly without human interaction in most scenarios.

### Elasticity through Auto-scaling

* Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost

### Key Aspects Cloud Economics

#### Pay-as-you-go

* charging model that allows you to pay based on compute and storage resources used or by the second/minute/hour.

#### Metering

* The ability of provider to automate the tracking of all resources to support the measured usage service.
* facilitates the pay-as-you-go and demand-driven features of CSPs for billing, monitoring, and reporting.

#### Cloud Bursting

* The process of running applications on internal resources or a private cloud then “bursting up” to a public/hybrid cloud solution

#### Chargeback

* accounting approach that decentralizes the cost of it services and applies them to the budgets of the teams or business units.
* eliminates the need to consolidate all service costs under one bill.
* Many private clouds and internal IT departments will use the term “showback” instead.

### AWS CAF (Cloud adoption Framework)

* CAF organizes guidance at a high level into six areas of focus, called **perspectives**.
* Each perspective focuses on discrete responsibilities
* Business capabilities: Business, people, governance perspectives
* Technical capabilities: Operations, Security, Platform perspectives

### AWS Compliance

#### AWS Artifact

* AWS Artifact is a compliance information resource.
* \*\*\*\*AWS Artifact provides access to official documentation on the compliance of AWS infrastructure relating to any one of dozens of government or industry security standards.
* AWS Artifact’s Components:
  * Artifact Agreements:
    * assists with signing agreements with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS service.
  * Artifact Reports:
    * helps with providing compliance reports from third-party auditors.

> Will the application you plan to run on AWS be processing credit card transactions? What about private health records, personal employment histories, or restricted military information? Are you sure the AWS security and reliability environment is good enough to meet the regulatory standards required by your industry and government?

But where can you find authoritative answers? **AWS Artifact**
